Vijay spent his entire childhood in Chennai. He did his schooling initially in Fathima Matriculation Higher Secondary School[14] at Kodambakkam and later joined Balalok Matriculation Higher Secondary School[15] at Virugambakkam and went on to pursue a degree in Visual Communications from Loyola College, though he would eventually drop out as he was more interested in pursuing acting.[12]

Vijay married his ardent fan, a Hindu British Sri Lankan Tamil, Sangeetha Sornalingam, on 25 August 1999 in both Hindu and Christian tradition.[16][17] They have two children, a son Jason Sanjay born in 2000 in London[18] and a daughter Divya Shasha born in 2005 in Chennai.[19] Jason Sanjay made a cameo appearance with his father in Vettaikaaran (2009) and Divya Shasha portrayed a small role as her father's pre-teen daughter in Theri (2016).
